# Tenzies is a dice rolling game

### The user must match 10 dice with the same number to win

#### The game app uses JavaScript, React, HTML and CSS. I also used UUID and "React-Confetti"

### Click on a die will freeze that number on subsequent rolls

### You must match and click all numbers to win.

### After matching and "holding" all the dice, the user gets confetti and gets to reset their board.
